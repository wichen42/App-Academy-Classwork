Write a method perfect_square? that accepts a number as an argument. The method should return a boolean indicating whether or not the argument 
is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that is the product of some number multiplied by itself. 
For example, since 64 = 8 * 8 and 144 = 12 * 12, 64 and 144 are perfect squares; 35 is not a perfect square.
